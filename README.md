# Open Street Map San Francisco Bay Area

In this project, we grabbed data for the SF Bay Area from Open Street Map, audited it, cleaned it, and then imported it into a database for futher analysis.

`sample-osm.py` takes in an .osm file and outputs a smaller sample .osm.
`Open Street Map Wrangling - SF Bay Area.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that outlines the data wrangling process and performs some analysis on the data.
